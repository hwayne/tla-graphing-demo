[Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is an interactive graph analysis toolkit I used to make the graph image in the repo. You can try loading the file if you want to play around with it.

What exists of the documentation can be found [here](https://gephi.org/users/) and [here](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki). It doesn't explain very much and I honestly didn't find any of it helpful.
